ChatGPT has revolutionized how we interact with AI. In this guide, we'll explore how to integrate ChatGPT into your applications and make the most of its powerful capabilities.

## Why ChatGPT?

ChatGPT offers several compelling features for developers:

- **Natural Language Processing**: Advanced understanding of human language
- **Versatile API**: Easy integration with any application
- **Customizable Responses**: Fine-tune outputs for your specific needs
- **Multi-language Support**: Works across different languages

## Setting Up ChatGPT API

Getting started with the ChatGPT API is straightforward:

```javascript
import { Configuration, OpenAIApi } from 'openai';

const configuration = new Configuration({
  apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
});

const openai = new OpenAIApi(configuration);

async function getChatGPTResponse(prompt) {
  const completion = await openai.createChatCompletion({
    model: "gpt-3.5-turbo",
    messages: [{ role: "user", content: prompt }],
  });
  
  return completion.data.choices[0].message.content;
}
```

## Key Concepts

### 1. Prompts

Writing effective prompts is crucial for getting the best results:

```javascript
const prompt = `
Generate a JavaScript function that:
1. Takes an array as input
2. Sorts it in ascending order
3. Returns the sorted array
`;
```

### 2. Response Handling

Always handle responses appropriately:

```javascript
try {
  const response = await getChatGPTResponse(prompt);
  console.log(response);
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Error:', error.message);
}
```
